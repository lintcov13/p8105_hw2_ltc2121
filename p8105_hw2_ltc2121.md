## Problem 1

Data input

``` r
nyc_subway = read_csv("hw2_data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
  col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, 
    starts_with("route"), entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, 
    ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

The variables in the dataset are line, station_name, station_latitude,
station_longitude, route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6,
route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, entry, exit_only, vending,
entrance_type, ada. The data has 1868 rows and 20 columns.Since the data
has been imported and selected for the variables of interest. The names
have been standardized with the janitor clean names function. The
variable type has also be changes for several of the variables. Overall
the data is not completely tidy because it is in a wide format. To
convert to a longer dataframe, route could be one variable with the
route number as the value.

``` r
nyc_subway %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
```

## Problem 2

Data input

``` r
trash_wheel = read_excel("hw2_data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
                         sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", 
                         col_types = 
                          c("guess","guess","guess","guess","guess","guess","guess","guess","guess",
                            "guess","guess","guess","guess","guess", "skip", "skip")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dumpster))  %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
         wheel_num = 1, 
         year = as.numeric(year))

pro_trash_wheel = read_excel("hw2_data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
                         sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dumpster)) %>% 
  mutate(wheel_num = 2)

all_trash = bind_rows(trash_wheel, pro_trash_wheel)

pro_total <- all_trash %>% 
  filter(wheel_num == 2) %>% 
  summarise(sum(weight_tons))

sballs <- trash_wheel %>% 
  filter(year == 2020) %>% 
      summarise(sum(sports_balls))
```

The variables in the dataframe with both Mr. Trash Wheel and Professor
Trash Wheel are dumpster, month, year, date, weight_tons,
volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts,
glass_bottles, grocery_bags, chip_bags, sports_balls, homes_powered,
wheel_num. The dataframe has a total of 641 observations. The range of
years for trash collection in the total dataframe are between 2014 and
2022. From the current data, the total amount of trash collected by
Professor Trash Wheel is 190.12 tons. The total number of sports balls
collected by Mr. Trash Wheel in 2020 was 856 balls.

## Problem 3

Tidy of the pols_month data

``` r
pols_month = read_csv("hw2_data/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  separate(col = mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>% 
  mutate(month = as.numeric(month), 
         month = month.abb[month], 
         prez_gop = if_else(prez_gop > 0, "gop", NA_character_), 
         prez_dem = if_else(prez_dem > 0, "dem", NA_character_), 
         year = as.numeric(year)) %>% 
   pivot_longer(
    c(prez_gop, prez_dem), 
    names_to = "rid", 
    values_to = "president") %>%  
  filter(!is.na(president)) %>%   
  select(-c(rid, day))
```

    ## Rows: 822 Columns: 9
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl  (8): prez_gop, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, prez_dem, gov_dem, sen_dem, r...

    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Tidy of the snp data

``` r
snp_df = read_csv("hw2_data/snp.csv") %>% 
  separate(col = date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/") %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year), 
         year = if_else(year > 22, (year + 1900), 
                        if_else(year <= 22, (year + 2000) , NA_real_))) %>% 
  mutate(month = as.numeric(month), 
         month = month.abb[month]) %>% 
  select(-day) %>% 
  select(year, month, close)
```

    ## Rows: 787 Columns: 2
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): date
    ## dbl (1): close
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Tidy of the unemployment data

``` r
unemployment_df = read_csv("hw2_data/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec, 
    names_to = "month", 
    values_to = "perc_unemployment"
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

    ## Rows: 68 Columns: 13
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (13): Year, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec

    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Joining the Dataframes

``` r
pm_snp = full_join(pols_month, snp_df, by = c("year", "month"))

full_join_3 = full_join(pm_snp, unemployment_df, by = c("year", "month"))
```

The pols_month datafram contains 822 observations. This dataframe has
information about the number of national politicians who are democratic
or republican at any given month between the years of 1947 and 2015. I
used tidy functions to make a new variable called ‘president’ which
indicates if this position was held by a democrat or republican.
Initially this was respresented with two different logic variables that
were assigned to each political party. The snp dataframe contains 787
observations and it has the variable ‘close’ which shows the closing
values of the Standard & Poor’s stock market index (S&P). This
information ranges between the years of 1950 and 2015. The unemployment
dataframe contains 816 observations. Each observation is a percentage of
unemployment for each month between the years of 1948 to 2015. The
combind dataframe holds all key variables noted and ranges from the
years of 1947 to 2015.
