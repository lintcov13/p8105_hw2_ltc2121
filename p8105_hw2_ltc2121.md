## Problem 1

Data input

``` r
nyc_subway = read_csv("hw2_data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
  col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, 
    starts_with("route"), entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, 
    ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

The variables in the dataset are line, station_name, station_latitude,
station_longitude, route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6,
route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, entry, exit_only, vending,
entrance_type, ada. The data has 1868 rows and 20 columns.Since the data
has been imported and selected for the variables of interest. The names
have been standardized with the janitor clean names function. The
variable type has also be changes for several of the variables. Overall
the data is not completely tidy because it is in a wide format. To
convert to a longer dataframe, route could be one variable with the
route number as the value.

``` r
nyc_subway %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
